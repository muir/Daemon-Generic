=head1 NAME

 Daemon::Generic::While1 - Daemon framework with default while(1) loop

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 @ISA = qw(Daemon::Generic::While1);

 sub gd_run_body {
	# stuff
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a slight variation on L<Daemon::Generic>: a default
C<gd_run()> provided.  It has a while(1) loop that calls 
C<gd_run_body()> over and over.  It checks for reconifg and
and terminate events and only actions them between calls
to C<gd_run_body()>. 

Terminate events will be forced through after 
C<$Daemon::Generic::force_quit_delay> seconds if
C<gd_run_body()> doesn't return quickly enough.

=head1 SUBCLASS METHODS REQUIRD

The following method is required to be overridden to subclass
Daemon::Generic::While1:

=over 15

=item gd_run_body()

This method will be called over and over.  This method should
include a call to C<sleep(1)> (or a bit more).  Reconfig events
will not interrupt it.  Quit events will only interrupt it 
after 15 seconds.  

=back

=head1 ADDITIONAL METHODS

The following additional methods are available for your use
(as compared to L<Daemon::Generic>):

=over 15

=item gd_sleep($period)

This will sleep for C<$period> seconds but in one-second
intervals so that if a SIGINT or SIGHUP arrives the sleep
period can end more quickly.

Using this makes it safe for C<gd_run_body()> to sleep for
longer than C<$Daemon::Generic::force_quit_delay> seconds 
at a time.

=back

=head1 ADDITIONAL MEMBER DATA

The following additional bits of member data are defined:

=over 15

=item gd_sigint

The time at which an (unprocessed) SIGINT was received.

=item gd_sighup

The time at which an (unprocessed) SIGHUP was received.

=back
